# Processing Projects
Projects created for my coursework assignments for the BSc Creative Computing degree courses.
# Year 1 Projects
Projects are simple processing sketches using simple vertex structure and HSB colour schemes.
# Year 2 Project
A sound visualisation sketch created using the techniques of data filtering, by the means of low pass and high pass filter. Filtered tracks are mapped to animations such that visualiser animates with the music.
