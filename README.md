# Processing Projects
Projects created for my coursework assignments for the BSc Creative Computing degree courses. 
The pde files are runnable using the Processing IDE available to be downloaded at https://processing.org/download/.
# Year 1 Projects
Projects are simple processing sketches using simple vertex structure and HSB colour schemes.
The projects are in the "ThePeaceSign" and "TheFourSeasons" folders.
# Year 2 Project
A sound visualisation sketch created using the techniques of data filtering, by the means of low pass and high pass filter. Filtered tracks are mapped to animations such that visualiser animates with the music.
The project for Year 2 is in the "Filtering" folder.
# Year 3 Projects
The projects are done for two different half modules namely 'Sound and Music' and 'Advanced Graphics and Animation'. 
For 'Sound and Music', the project I've done is an interactive generative music system that allows user to play with the panel to create music.
There are two parts of projects for 'Advanced Graphics and Animation'. The first one focuses on creating light shaders using GLSL shaders to model Phong, Gouraud, and Cook-Torrance Light Shading Models. The second one explores on texture modelling, which includes texture mapping, texture animation, displacement mapping, as well as a creative artefact that combines some techniques that I learnt from the degree courses.
The project for 'Sound and Music' is named "InteractiveMusicGenerator".
The project for 'Advanced Graphics and Animation' are named "Light Shaders", "Texture Shaders", and "Creative Artefact".
