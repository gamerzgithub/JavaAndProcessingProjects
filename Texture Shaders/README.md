# Processing mini project: Texture Shaders
This mini project explores on texture modelling, which includes texture mapping, texture animation, displacement mapping.
This file consist of two parts, texture mapping and displacement mapping.
## Texture mapping
The requirements for this part to complete the assignment:
* Map textures onto the object and allow the user to change textures
* Animate the mapped textures
* Allow user to apply different image processing effects on the textures
## Displacement mapping 
The requirements is the same for texture mapping, excluding texture animation part. In addition, this part is required to:
* Map displacement of textures onto the object
* Allow user to change the level of displacement
