# Processing mini project: The Peace Sign
The first mini project / coursework assignment for this degree programme. The requirement for this assignment was to incorporate randomness into the project,
and this mini project satisfied the requirement by sketching randomly appeared peace signs that forms a larger peace sign, with each of them assigned with random colours.
